# PDF Resizer and Merger Web App

A lightweight web application built with Flask for resizing and merging multiple PDF files. The app ensures all pages in the merged output are uniformly resized to fit standard A4 dimensions while maintaining the original content's aspect ratio.

## Features

- Upload Multiple PDFs: Easily upload multiple PDF files through the browser.
- Uniform Page Sizing: All pages are resized to standard A4 dimensions (595x842 points).
- PDF Merging: Combines all uploaded files into a single, resized PDF.
- Download Output: Download the processed PDF directly after merging.

## Why This App?

Merging PDFs often results in mismatched page sizes, making them difficult to view or print uniformly. This app addresses this issue by resizing each page to a standard size, ensuring consistency in the final output.

## Key Functions

### Resizing and Merging PDFs

The core functionality is handled by the resize_and_merge_pdfs function in app.py. This function:
- Resizes all pages to A4 dimensions while preserving their aspect ratio.
- Merges the resized pages into a single PDF.

## Customization

- Target Page Size: Modify the target_size parameter in resize_and_merge_pdfs to use custom dimensions.
- Port Number: Change the port in app.run(debug=True, port=5001) to host on a different port.
